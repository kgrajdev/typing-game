# About 
Game created as part of the Kenney Jam 2025
- The game is also competing in the Single Pack challenge

This is a simple word typing game. Try to get a high score, avoid mistakes.

This is a fast-paced game that puts your typing speed and accuracy to the test! Words will appear on the screen one by one, and your mission is simple: type them correctly before time runs out.

# How to Play

- Words will appear on the screen. 
- Type each word exactly as shown, as soon as you get the last letter correct, you will be awarded points - and a new word.
- Do not let the timer run out, or the game will be over.
- You get 3 mistakes per game


# Scoring System

- points awarded per completed word are based on how fast the word was completed
- there are also penalty points: for each mistake and for timing out

# Achievements

- The game has some basic achievements in place

### Kenney Jam 2025 Theme - Power
